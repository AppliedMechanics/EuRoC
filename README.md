# AM-Robotics EuRoC Code

A Flexible Robotic Framework for Autonomous Manufacturing Processes

# Goals

The goal of the project is to provide a basic framework for intelligent Pick-and-Place tasks.

It is based on [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and makes use of state-of-the-art algorithms and libraries.

# Background

In 2014, the [European Robotics Challenges (EuRoC)](http://www.euroc-project.eu/) were launched with the aim of advancing robotic technologies for the next generation of intelligent industrial processes.

The [Institute of Applied Mechanics](https://www.amm.mw.tum.de/en/home/) of the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/) participated in the challenge 2 of the EuRoC with the team AM-Robotics. In it, competitor teams had to develop autonomous robot systems for logistics and robotic co-workers. 

For the stage 1 (simulatio), various pick-and-place tasks had to be performed without any user interaction while dealing with uncertain object localization, calibration errors, obstructed environments and multi-level decision processes.

The team AM-Robotics ranked first at stage 1 of the challenge amongst 39 teams, using this framework. It includes modules for object recognition and environment modeling, grasping, motion planning as well as an intelligent state machine.
