Howto setup an eclipse project with the euroc-code:

1) check bashrc:
   -> type in terminal: eb
   -> an editor opens with the bashrc-file, go to the end of the file
   -> edit the line with "MYROSPACKAGEPATH=" with your branch-directory
      (e.g. MYROSPACKAGEPATH=/home/euroc_student/EUROC_SVN/branches/grasping)
   -> save the file (ctrl-x,ctrl-s)
   -> close the file (ctrl-x,ctrl-c)
   -> type in terminal: sb 
      (there should be no output visible)

2) change in your branch-folder (e.g. /home/euroc_student/EUROC_SVN/branches/grasping)

3) check whether there's a build folder  
   -> if not, type in terminal: catkin_ec

4) open eclipse (type in terminal: ec)

5) if there is an existing project in eclipse -> delete the project 
   (but not the disc-content)

6) import the project with file->import
   -> Select as source "General/Existing Projects into Workspace"
   -> "Select root directory -> Browse" 
   -> Select your branch folder as root 
     (e.g.  /home/euroc_student/EUROC_SVN/branches/grasping)
   -> Finish
